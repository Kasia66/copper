## What is Copper?

Copper is the name of a command line tool (CLI) and a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for validating configuration files.

## Why do I need Copper?

We built Copper to make sure our infrastructure is stable and secure. More and more we use code to describe infrastructure: if you use tools like Kubernetes, you know how you can use configuration files to change your infrastructure settings as well as deploy your applications.

As infrastructure configuration becomes part of the code, we wanted to apply the same principles of quality we use for code to our configuration files. It sounded strange to be the champions of "Infrastructure as Code" and yet not use all of best practices of developing code for our infrastructure.

If you use rely heavily on configuration files then Copper is for you. Particularly if you use Kubernetes, Copper can help you a lot.
